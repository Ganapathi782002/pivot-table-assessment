# About Pivot Craft
Using this App the user can construct pivot table for their Excel or CSV files.

## File validation

In this project, I have used the file validation functionality which checks whether an uploaded file is an Excel or CSV file. If the user uploads some other file with other different formats it will raise an error.

## Preview Feature

As soon as the file uploads, the user can preview the first five rows to verify whether fields like date are parsed correctly.

## Crafting a Pivot Table

The user can create a pivot table by clicking on 'Craft a Pivot Table' button.
In the fields pane, the user can select the fields under a Row, Column and Values.
They can also select different aggregations like Sum(default), Average and Count for different values they select from the values field.

## Bonus functionality

The user can even download their pivot table as an excel file by clicking on 'Download as Excel' button.
